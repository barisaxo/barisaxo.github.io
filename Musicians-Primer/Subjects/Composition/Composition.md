> There is no right or wrong method to writing music. Many artists like to start with lyrics and build the music around them. I believe Maynard from the band TOOL is all about the music first. If I remember correctly in articles and interviews, Maynard discusses that he often lets the band finish all of their parts before he writes his melodies, and only then he writes lyrics.

> *Better to play the wrong note at the right time*

Rhythm is the relative length of a note or a series of notes. Combinations of short & long notes are essential to making music interesting. 

Syncopation is an emphasis of the 'off beat' rhythms. There are multiple ways to achieve this. With the Rhythm Cell method syncopated figures use rests and ties, and are easy to anticipate.

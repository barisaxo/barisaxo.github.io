                A chord symbol is an expectation of tonality. It is not a descriptor of what voicing should be
                played. In fact, it is a better descriptor as what notes not to play.
                <br><br>
                For instance the chord symbol C<m-ma />, does not necessarily mean you have to voice the major 7th in
                the chord. It means if you are going to voice the 7th, make sure it's the major 7th!
                <br><br>
                The player has the freedom to voice the chord however they see fit. Sometimes chords can even be
                substituted with entirely different chords, as long as the tonality and/or function is
                fulfilled.
                <br><br>
                If an arrangement needs to express specific voicings, sheet music, tablature, or chord diagrams should
                be used.
                <br><br>
                Do not write chords like D7sus4(add9, no5). That's nonsense. D7(sus), D9(sus), or even C/D are much
                better options. If a voicing needs to be specific, use a chord diagram such as: x5555x else let the
                player voice the chord however they wish.

                If chord of the same family and/or functions are interchangeable, why are there so many different
                symbols?
                <br> <br>
                Because people over analyze voicings in their chord symbols!
                <br> <br>
                Here are a few reasons why a transcriber or arranger might use a certain chord symbol:
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; They transcribed so and so musician who played x/y chord voicing. (This is not a good use of
                chord symbols!)
                <br> <br>
                &#x2022; To make the player aware of a melody note, so the player can be careful not to play a voicing
                that would clash. (This is a good use of chord symbols)
                <br> <br>
                &#x2022; The arrangement calls for a specific voicing to be played. (Not great, again use sheet music,
                tabs,
                or diagrams)

                A voicing is the specific arrangement of notes in the chord stack.<br>
                <br>

                An E- chord might be voiced as:<br>
                E G B<br>
                E B G<br>
                B G E<br>
                E G <br>
                E B <br>
                E G B G<br>
                E G B D<br>
                E G D F<m-u>s</m-u><br>
                F<m-u>s</m-u> G B D<br>
                <br>
                Yup! You don't always have to use notes exclusive to the triad - not even the root.<br>
                Triads are tools to build arithmetic, they are not necessary musical implementations.<br>
                <br>
                Of course, dense harmonies and rootless voicings might not always be the best choice.<br>
                That depends the on context of the music being played.<br>
                <br>
                But neither are chord symbols obligations that E- means you must always play E G B.<br>
                <br>
                There is no right or wrong. All answers are correct - in context.<br>
                The only 'rule' in music is: Does it sound good?

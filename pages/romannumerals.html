        <h1>Roman Numerals</h1>

        <div id="box-one">
            Roman numerals are used to analyze chords - 'Roman Numeral Analysis' (RNA).
            <br>
            There are three main conventions: classical, jazz (Mark Levine), and the Nashville Number System (though
            technically not roman numerals).
            <br>
            <br>
            I generally work with more modern music than classical, so I will primarily be using the jazz conventions.
            <br>
            It is important to follow the conventions of whatever circle you happen to be in.
            <br>
            "Bad conventions are better than no conventions at all."
            <br>
            I will not be going to deep into each of these conventions because that is a chapter all in itself.
            <br>
            The main difference between jazz and classical is that jazz uses all upper case romans.
            <br>
            <br>
            Roman numerals are used to abstract chord progressions, the same way scale degrees are used to abstract
            melodies.
